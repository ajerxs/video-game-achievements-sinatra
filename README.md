This Sinatra app is designed to be able to add, keep track of, and manipulate video games and achievements in a database. A user can sign up and associate games and their achievements with their account. They can also make posts for all users to see in case a pesky achievement is giving them issues and they need a place to vent (or celebrate when they finally get it).

Instructions:

1) Clone the repo.

2) Navigate to the file and run 'bundle install' in the terminal.

3) Run 'rake db:migrate' and 'rake db:seed' to fill some data.

4) Run 'shotgun' in the terminal and navigate to the correct port in the browser.

5) Sign up.

From this point you should be able to navigate the page with the appropriate buttons and nav tags to get around the app.
